This study evaluates simplified Anaerobic Digestion (AD) models to determine their efficacy in replicating methane production kinetics from solid waste digestion. The research utilizes model structures akin to those proposed by Bernard et al. and Mairet et al., employing parameter estimation to fit these models to an extensive experimental dataset. Various model structures, kinetic equations, and simple inhibition descriptions were applied to identify the best fit.

The objective is to pinpoint the simplest model capable of accurately describing the digestion kinetics of complex solid wastes, such as food waste (FW) and green waste (GW). Previous studies have predominantly used Contois or first-order kinetics for hydrolysis and Monod and/or Haldane kinetics for acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. This study explores a variety of kinetic combinations, including the less commonly used Moser and Tessier kinetics, to better replicate observed process kinetics. The comparison of different kinetic models is conducted using linear and non-linear regression techniques to fit experimental data from a USAB digester.
